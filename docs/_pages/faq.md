  <summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; cursor: pointer; padding: 5px 0;">What age ranges do you train?</summary>
  
  <p style="margin-top: 10px;">At Elite Texas Taekwondo, we train individuals ranging from ages 5 to 100. Martial arts offer a transformative experience that benefits people across nearly all stages of life. For young children, ages 5 and up, martial arts help develop foundational motor skills, discipline, and respect, all in a structured and supportive environment. As they grow, these young practitioners learn to set and achieve goals, fostering self-confidence and a strong sense of accomplishment.</p>

  <p>For adults and older individuals, martial arts can offer an incredible means of staying physically fit, mentally sharp, and socially engaged. Training promotes flexibility, cardiovascular health, and muscle strength while also providing stress relief and a sense of community. We believe that martial arts can be a lifelong journey, continually offering new challenges and opportunities for growth.</p>

  <p>While we recognize the profound impact martial arts can have on people of all ages, we generally start training children at age 5. This is because younger children often do not yet possess the attention span or cognitive maturity to fully engage with structured martial arts training. Our goal is to ensure that every student has a positive, enriching experience tailored to their developmental stage, laying a strong foundation for future learning and success.</p>
