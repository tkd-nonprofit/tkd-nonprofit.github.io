# Introduction
Elite Texas Taekwondo ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy describes how we handle your information when you use our mobile application, Elite Texas Taekwondo (the "App").

## No Data Collection
We want to be clear and transparent: Elite Texas Taekwondo does not collect, use, store, or share any personal information from our users.

## What Information We Do Not Collect

Because our App does not collect any data, we do not collect any of the following, including, but not limited to:
Personally Identifiable Information (PII): This includes your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, or any other information that could be used to identify you.

Usage Data: We do not track your usage patterns, features used, time spent in the App, or any other behavioral data.
Device Information: We do not collect information about the device you use to access our App, such as device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, or mobile network information.

Location Information: We do not collect or track your location data.
Log Data: We do not collect or record logs regarding your use of this application.
Cookies: We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any similar tracking technologies.
User-Generated Content: We do not collect or store any user-generated content that may be created within the App.
Data from Third Parties: We do not collect any data about you from third parties.

## Why We Do Not Collect Data
Elite Texas Taekwondo is designed to operate entirely locally on your device. It does not require the collection of user data to function. Our core philosophy is to respect user privacy and provide a functional App without needing personal information.

## Data Security
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not store any user data, and there is no risk of a data breach from our app.

## Third-Party Services
Because we do not collect any user data, we do not share user data with any third-party services.

## Children's Privacy
Elite Texas Taekwondo does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children. Therefore, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) does not apply to our app.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this privacy policy are effective when they are posted on this page. We will not notify you of any updates to this page because we do not collect user data.
