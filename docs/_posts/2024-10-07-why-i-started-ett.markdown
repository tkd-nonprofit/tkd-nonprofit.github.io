## Why I Started {{ site.school_name }}

Segueing from the previous post, the importance of community is deeply personal to me.

- Community keeps you connected.
- Community keeps you accountable.
- Community gives you purpose.

When I was a teenager, I found my way into martial arts through a community center on the southside of San Antonio. It wasn’t just a place to train—it became a refuge, a place where I could test my limits, discover my strengths, and grow in ways I never imagined. The people, the parents, the volunteers—they were the hands that lifted me up, the voices that said, “You can be more.”

It was that sense of belonging, the friends, the mentorship, and the discipline I learned that shaped me. Those experiences planted a seed of determination, watered by the dedication of my community, which has since grown into the vision for {{ site.school_name }}.

This is not just a school, and it’s not just a dream—this is my way of giving back, recreating that very environment that made me who I am. We are not in this to simply teach kicks and punches; we are in this to change lives, to build character, and to shape a better tomorrow. This journey is about more than just me, more than just today—it’s about planting seeds that will bear fruit for generations to come.

We pour our hearts into these young athletes, these future leaders. When we give to Elite Texas Taekwondo, we’re not just giving to an organization—we’re giving to a mission, to a vision that’s bigger than any one of us. 

I see this organization as a sprout—a small beginning with mighty potential. And just like that sprout needs water, sunlight, and care, we too need the dedication, the time, and the support of everyone involved. With each passing day, we’re not just building better athletes; we’re building a better community—stronger, more resilient, and full of hope.

It is said, "To whom much is given, much is required." And I have had the privilege of having been given so much by my community growing up. Now, I am called to pay it forward, to ensure that what was done for me can be done for the next generation. This is just the beginning, but I believe that if we nurture this sprout, if we water it with love and dedication, we will see it grow into something great. Something lasting. Something that makes a difference.

We are just getting started, but the best is yet to come.
